# 🧠 OOPs Concepts in C++

This repository contains basic implementations of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts using **C++**. It was created as a part of my learning during the **first year** of engineering.

## 📁 What’s Included

The repo demonstrates the following key OOP concepts:

- **Classes & Objects**
- **Encapsulation**
- **Inheritance** (Single, Multilevel, Hierarchical)
- **Polymorphism** (Compile-time & Runtime)
- **Abstraction**
- **Constructors & Destructors**
- **Friend Function**
- **Operator Overloading**
- **Virtual Functions**

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Language:** C++
- **Platform:** VS Code / Code::Blocks 

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/oops-concepts-cpp.git
   cd oops-concepts-cpp
   ```

2. Open any `.cpp` file in your preferred C++ IDE or editor.


## 📚 Learning Objective

This repo was made to strengthen my understanding of:

- Structuring code using classes
- Understanding how inheritance works
- Exploring runtime behavior using polymorphism
- Using constructors/destructors to manage object lifecycle
- Applying encapsulation and abstraction in real scenarios
